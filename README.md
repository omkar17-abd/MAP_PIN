# MAP_PIN

The MAP_PIN project is a comprehensive web application developed using the MERN (MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, Node.js) stack. The primary goal of this application is to provide users with a platform where they can easily pin any location of their choice on a map and write detailed reviews about those locations, including descriptions, ratings, and titles.
